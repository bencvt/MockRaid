# MockRaid by bencvt

Render a mocked-up World of Warcraft raid group as an HTML page. Includes a set of raid frames, a damage meter window, and a healing meter window.

See `preview.png` for an example of how the page is rendered. You can easily change the raid roster to suit your needs - see the HTML source.

The git repo is hosted at: https://github.com/bencvt/MockRaid
