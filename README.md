# MockRaid by bencvt

Render a mocked-up World of Warcraft raid group as an HTML page. Includes a set of raid frames, a damage meter window, and a healing meter window.

See `preview.png` for an example of how the page is rendered. You can easily change the raid roster to suit your needs - see the HTML source.

The git repo is hosted at: https://github.com/bencvt/MockRaid

## Note about art and font assets

Blizzard owns the copyright to the group role icon images (`assets/*.png`). The images are included in this project with Blizzard's explicit permission, per the fansites section on: http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/company/about/legal-faq.html

The style sheet references Friz Quadrata, the WoW standard font. This font is *not* included in this project, so if you do not have a local copy of this file (`FRIZQT__.ttf`), the web page will use an alternate font.
